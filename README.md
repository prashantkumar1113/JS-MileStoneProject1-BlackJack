# JS-MileStoneProject1-BlackJack

## My version of Blackjack for Milestone Project 1

### Deliverables

1. My game will be Player vs Dealer(Computer)
2. Need to build Card and Deck classes
    - create a deck
    - shuffle the deck
3. Player should be able to bet ($10, $25, $100)
4. Need to manipulate the DOM to display Cards and bets
    - Display a card with a suit
    - hide the dealers second card
    - Keep track of the bets from game to game
    - Need to account for Aces being 1 or 13 depending on the value of the hand

### Stretch Goals

1. Split - when a player has 2 cards of the same rank
2. Insurance? - when the Dealer's whole Card is showing a face card

### Super Stretch Goals

1. Turn this game into Euchre
